# Arpeggio

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/harryjubb/arpeggio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/harryjubb/arpeggio)

## Outline

Arpeggio calculates interatomic contacts based on the rules defined in [CREDO](http://marid.bioc.cam.ac.uk/credo). The program is freely available and requires only Open Source dependencies.

If you make use of Arpeggio, please cite the following article:

## Getting Started

**Stuck?** Start here, and see also the [FAQ](https://github.com/harryjubb/arpeggio#frequently-asked-questions).

### Web Interface

If you would like to run Arpeggio on a small number of individual structures, the easiest way to get started is to use the [web interface](http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/arpeggioweb/).

### Programmatically

If you need to use Arpeggio programmatically or to run for many structures:

The easiest way to get started is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

#### Using the public Docker image

Arpeggio's Docker image is [hosted on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/harryjubb/arpeggio/). To use:

    docker pull harryjubb/arpeggio

Once downloaded, Arpeggio can be run using:

    docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/run -u `id -u`:`id -g` -it harryjubb/arpeggio python arpeggio.py /run/1XKK.pdb -s RESNAME:FMM -v

Breaking this down:

- `docker run`: run the image
- `--rm`: clean up the Docker container when the run is finished
- `-v`: bind-mount a host machine directory in the container (with your input files, and where your output files will appear). In this case, the current working directory will be mounted to `/run` in the container
- ``-u `id -u`:`id -g` ``: Set the user and group in the Docker container to match the host user and group running the container, so that any files written are written as the correct user
- `-it`: interactive run with a pseudo-TTY terminal
- `arpeggio`: the name of the built Docker image
- `python arpeggio.py`: run Arpeggio
- `/run/1XKK.pdb`: a PDB file in our mounted host directory
- `-s RESNAME:FMM -v`: options passed to Arpeggio, in this case, to calculate interactions for residue with name FMM, and show verbose output

#### Building the Docker image

You can build the docker image from inside this repository with:

    docker build -t 'arpeggio' .

#### Installing without Docker

If it is not possible to use Docker, please read on for dependencies for manual installation.

## Dependencies

Arpeggio is written in Python and currently has the following dependencies:

### Dependencies

- Python (v2.7)
- Numpy
- BioPython (>= v1.60)
- OpenBabel (with Python bindings)

### Recommended
- PyMOL (for visualising contacts)

Arpeggio may work with earlier versions of BioPython, however these haven't been tested. It is recommended that each dependency be the latest version.

## Running

`python arpeggio.py pdb [options]`

Use `python arpeggio.py -h` for available options.

Arpeggio doesn't do any checking of your PDB structure, other than what BioPython does by default. Alternate locations and missing density are not explicitly accounted for and may result in anomalous results. Please use with caution.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**See also the [GitHub issue questions](https://github.com/harryjubb/arpeggio/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Aquestion).**

### BioPython/OpenBabel are complaining about my structure, what's happening?

Both can be picky about the format of PDB files, for example atom serials must be unique (to map between BioPython and OpenBabel structures), and other issues can raise BioPython errors.

The `clean_pdb.py` script in https://github.com/harryjubb/pdbtools resolves a number of common errors; if your structure doesn't work, try using that first before trying Arpeggio on the cleaned structure.

### My results don't match the output of the web server, what's happening?

In order to prevent errors from BioPython/OpenBabel (described above) causing Arpeggio to fail, the web server preprocesses input PDB files before running Arpeggio. The `clean_pdb.py` script in https://github.com/harryjubb/pdbtools provides this functionality outside of the web server.

Please also be aware that changing command line options may also result in differences from the web server's output. Arpeggio is run on the web server with the `-wh` option, and an optional selection.

### `*.specific.sift`

Interaction fingerprints for individual atoms. These are binary (i.e., on/off) indications of an atom's interaction, not counts.

The columns match the `*.sift` files, but the first 15 columns (after the atom identifier) denote only interactions between the selection made by the user, and non-selection atoms; the second 15 columns indicate interactions made within the selection made by the user; and the third 15 columns indicate interactions made with water only.

### `*.siftmatch`, `*.polarmatch`

These files are for testing purposes.
